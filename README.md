This client has all of the functionality of the official one and works on any linux with bash, openvpn and ufw installed.


It also has the added advantage of using the versions of OpenVPN and OpenSSL installed on your system, which will always be more secure than the old fork of old versions of this software that the official PIA app uses.


pia can be run interactivley or with switches. It will only ask you to supply your credentials once and then after that it connects without asking.


The credentials file is protected by 'chmod 400', which means only the root user can view the file. If you have a malicious root user on your box it's game over anyway.


The ovpn files are editited and 'auth-nocache' option is added, which means openvpn will not store your creds in memory.
